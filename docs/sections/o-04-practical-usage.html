<p>Once you have created a Pearl component, you can subscribe your React/Vue/etc. components to the Pearl component state. Below is an example with React:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">import MyPearlComponent from &#39;MyPearlComponent&#39;;
class MyReactComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    this.state = {
      name: &#39;World&#39;
    };
    // create a variable that references our Pearl component
    this.MyPearlComponent = new MyPearlComponent();
    // subscribe to changes in the Pearl components state
    this.MyPearlComponent.subscribe( (newMyPearlComponentState) =&gt; {
      this.setState({
        name: newMyPearlComponentState.name
      });
    });
  }
  render() {
    return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {this.state.name}&lt;/h1&gt;;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>A few things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using the arrow function notation is <strong>required</strong> if your callback references MyReactComponent (which it probably will)</li>
  <li>You can use MyPearlComponent (and other extensions of Pearl) in any number of your own components. All pearl extensions act as singletons, so declaring a new MyPearlComponent() will still return the same reference</li>
  <li>This is important for adding your own functionalities to your Pearl components, such as methods that manipulate the component state</li>
</ul>
